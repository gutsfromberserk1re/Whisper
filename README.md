# Whisper
               Whisper without anyone's knowledge and without anyone storing your texts in a server
               -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------



               whisper is an app that stores your text locally and not in a server so theres no risk of leakage 
               theres no login system and code names are assigned after first log in. That is your way of contact
                only share your name if you trust them, names are the mean of contact. 
                Its a static messaging app so dont expect much, I could clean it up more but i prefer to keep it
                as it is.




                solo project made in 3 days 
                Would think of expanding idea further if i get some help from actual experienced people
